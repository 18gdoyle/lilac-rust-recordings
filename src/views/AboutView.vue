      Hey there! My name is Greg, but I go by Lilac Rust online. I've been making music for almost 10 years now and I've
      produced everything from acoustic ballads to trap
      bangers. I care very deeply about what I do, and I will not quit on a track until everything is perfect. I can
      produce instrumentals for a myriad of genres, as well as mix and master the track. I can take your musical
      endeavors from idea to completed song, as I have experience with every step in the songwriting, recording, mixing,
      and mastering process.
