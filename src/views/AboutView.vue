        Hey there!
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is Greg, but I go by Lilac Rust online. I've been making music for almost 10 years now and I've
        produced everything from acoustic ballads to trap
        bangers.
        <br />
        <br />
        I care very deeply about what I do, and I will not quit on a track until everything is perfect. I can
        produce instrumentals for a myriad of genres, record, mix, master, whatever you need!
        <br />
        <br />
        I currently do not have a studio open to the public, but I have a lot of experience in
        working with artists online (sending audio files back and forth, that sort of thing).
        <br />
        <br />
        Chances are, if you are doing something
        related to music, I can probably help you out. Just shoot me an email at <a class='hover-underline-animation'
          href='mailto:lilac.rust@gmail.com'>lilac.rust@gmail.com</a>
        and we'll chat.
        <br />
